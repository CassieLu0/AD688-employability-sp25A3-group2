    "text": "Drop Unnecessary Columns\nWhich columns should be dropped, and why?\nThe columns selected for removal are considered redundant because they either provide duplicate information, are unnecessary for analysis, or have more detailed equivalents in the dataset. For example, \"ID\" serves as a unique identifier but is often not needed for analysis, while \"URL\" and \"ACTIVE_URLS\" contain job posting links that are useful externally but not critical for data processing. Similarly, \"LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP\" is dropped because \"LAST_UPDATED_DATE\" already provides update information in a more readable format. The \"DUPLICATES\" column, which likely flags repeated entries, is also removed since duplicates can be handled separately.\nAdditionally, industry and occupational classification columns like \"NAICS2\" to \"NAICS6\" and \"SOC_2\", \"SOC_3\", \"SOC_5\" are removed because these represent different levels of classification, and more relevant or updated versions (e.g., \"NAICS_2022_2\" to \"NAICS_2022_6\") are already present in the dataset.

First, visualizing missing data with a heatmap helps identify patterns and assess severity. Columns with more than 50% missing values are dropped to avoid unreliable or incomplete data. For numerical fields like \"Salary\", filling missing values with the median ensures the data remains representative without being skewed by outliers. Categorical fields like \"Industry\" are filled with \"Unknown\" to maintain completeness while preserving interpretability.

From early May to the end of June, there is a noticeable decline in the number of job postings, dropping from around 14,000 to approximately 12,200. This dip could be attributed to seasonal factors, such as the end of academic semesters, mid-year budget reviews, or general summer slowdowns in corporate recruitment cycles. However, beginning in early July, the job market shows a sharp rebound, with postings rising significantly through August, eventually stabilizing at around 14,700. This resurgence likely reflects renewed hiring efforts following budget resets or organizational planning periods. The uptick in late summer also aligns with typical Q3 hiring trends, where companies ramp up recruitment ahead of the final quarter. For job seekers, this pattern suggests that while opportunities may temporarily slow in early summer, late July through August presents a strong window for applications as employers actively seek talent."

A key takeaway is that salaries for remote and hybrid roles tend to be higher and more consistent than those for on-site positions. Remote jobs, in particular, show a tight interquartile range clustered around $110K–$125K, indicating a strong market demand and willingness to pay for location-flexible roles.\nIn contrast, on-site (“Not Remote”) jobs show a broader distribution, with a wider range of salaries and a lower median. This suggests more variability in pay, possibly due to a wider mix of roles (from entry-level to senior) or differing cost-of-living adjustments by region.\nOverall, the visualization reinforces a trend seen across industries: remote and hybrid roles are not only desirable for flexibility but also competitive in compensation. Job seekers aiming for high-paying opportunities may benefit from targeting remote-friendly employers, especially in tech and analytics fields."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided a comprehensive overview of the 2024 job market landscape by examining job postings, salaries, and structural patterns across various dimensions.\n\nTop Industries by Postings A bar chart of the most active industries revealed strong hiring demand in sectors like technology, consulting, and staffing. This highlights which fields are driving employment opportunities.\nSalary Distribution by Industry A box plot compared salary ranges across top industries, showing clear disparities in compensation. Sectors like finance and tech offered both high pay and broad salary variability, while others showed lower, more consistent pay.\nRemote vs. On-Site Jobs A pie chart illustrated that the majority of job postings lacked explicit remote classification, but among those that did, remote jobs were more prevalent than on-site roles. This reflects the growing demand for flexible work arrangements.\nJob Postings by U.S. State A choropleth map identified geographic disparities in job availability, with states like Texas, California, and Florida leading in job volume. This helps job seekers target locations with strong hiring activity.\nJob Postings Over Time A time series line chart revealed a seasonal trend: a dip in postings during early summer followed by a strong recovery in July and August. This suggests mid-year slowdowns and hiring rebounds tied to business cycles.\nTop Job Titles by Frequency A horizontal bar chart showed that “Data Analyst” and related roles dominate the job market. The presence of various analyst titles reflects high demand for data-driven decision-making skills across industries.\nSalary Distribution by Job Type A box plot comparing remote, hybrid, and on-site roles indicated that remote and hybrid jobs offer competitive — often higher — median salaries. This supports the idea that flexibility and compensation can go hand in hand.\n\nTogether, these seven visualizations provide a well-rounded understanding of the job market’s current state — from what roles are most in demand, where they are, how much they pay, and how work modes affect earning potential. This foundation supports deeper analysis and career strategy planning for job seekers and workforce analysts alike."

Other important features include: education_levels_name_High school or GED, title_name_Data Analytics Engineers\nEmployers place strong emphasis on practical experience, sometimes even more than academic credentials. However, education level still plays a meaningful role, especially when combined with technical job titles like “Data Analysts” or “Data Analytics Engineers”. This plot helped us realize that work experience is the top factor to focus on for job readiness, while title and education serve as amplifiers."

Through exploratory data analysis, multiple regression, clustering, skill gap mapping, and text mining, we uncovered critical insights shaping employment opportunities. Our multiple regression model identified experience and job title as the strongest predictors of salary, with high-earning roles concentrated in states like California, New York, and Connecticut. KMeans clustering revealed that certain job types—particularly those in Cluster 1—are associated with significantly higher compensation and often appear in tech-dense regions. Our skill gap analysis showed alignment between in-demand skills (e.g., SQL, Python, Tableau) and the team’s current strengths, while also revealing areas for upskilling in cloud technologies and Linux. Finally, text analysis of job descriptions emphasized the importance of not just technical expertise but also teamwork, communication, and real-world project experience.\nBased on our findings, we advise job seekers to pursue roles in high-salary states or remote jobs based in those regions, focus on building practical experience, and prioritize mastering high-demand tools like SQL, cloud platforms, and visualization software. Tailoring resumes to reflect key industry terms and showcasing applied projects can also greatly improve competitiveness in today’s evolving job market."

As AI-driven roles grow in prevalence, traditional career trajectories are being redefined, creating both new opportunities and complex challenges across sectors and regions. At the same time, the increasing flexibility of remote work is reshaping workforce dynamics—affecting where professionals choose to live and how organizations approach hiring.\nThis report explores these changes through a comprehensive analysis of the lightcast_job_postings.csv dataset, with a focus on Geographic and Remote Work Analysis. Our goal is to understand the key factors influencing job availability, location-based salary trends, and the growing importance of remote work across industries. To achieve this, we conducted several forms of data analysis including skill gap analysis among group members, multiple regression modeling (using both Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression), K-Means clustering for pattern discovery, and text analysis of job descriptions via TF-IDF and Naive Bayes classification.\nVisualizations accompany each analytical component to enhance interpretation and communicate insights clearly. The report concludes with practical recommendations for job seekers, offering guidance on navigating the shifting employment landscape shaped by technology and workplace flexibility."

We further evaluate how hybrid models are shaping employer flexibility and employee mobility.\nThe Evolution of Tech Hubs and Regional Job Markets\nAre dominant tech centers like Silicon Valley still leading hiring, or are emerging hubs capturing more growth? We compare urban vs. rural job patterns, highlighting both salary and access disparities between regions.\n\nTogether, these themes offer a comprehensive look at how technology and flexibility are redefining modern employment."

    "text": "Insights_ Elbow Method (K-Means Clustering)\nIn the plot above, we applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for our K-Means clustering model. The Y-axis represents the inertia, which is the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster center. The X-axis shows different values of K, ranging from 1 to 10.\nWe can observe that inertia decreases as K increases, which is expected — more clusters naturally lead to tighter groupings and lower within-cluster variance. However, the key insight from the elbow method is to look for the point where the rate of inertia reduction starts to slow down, forming an “elbow” shape. In our case, this elbow appears around K = 3 or 4, where the curve starts to flatten noticeably. Choosing a K beyond this point leads to only marginal improvements in inertia, suggesting diminishing returns.\nBased on this analysis, we decided to use 4 clusters, which would likely balance interpretability and model effectiveness, helping us segment our data meaningfully without overfitting. This insight guides how we might group jobs, regions, or skills in our dataset for further analysis.\n\noptimal_k = 4"

Each row represents the actual ONET category, while each column shows how many jobs from that category were assigned to a given KMeans cluster. From the visualization, we can see that certain ONET labels aligned strongly with specific clusters—for instance, ONET label 1 is heavily concentrated in Cluster 0, with over 7,500 records, suggesting strong cohesion in that group. Similarly, ONET label 4 dominates Clusters 2 and 3, showing that KMeans successfully identified distinct subgroups within that label.\nHowever, other labels such as label 3 appear more scattered, indicating overlap between job types or fuzzier cluster boundaries. Interestingly, Clusters 4 and 5 were unused, suggesting that although we specified six clusters, only four were meaningfully populated. This may imply either redundancy in our chosen K value or limited variation in the feature space.\nOverall, this matrix provides a valuable check on how well our unsupervised clustering aligns with known job categories, revealing both strengths in classification and areas for improvement in feature design or model tuning."

As a student analyzing this data, this visualization emphasizes how geographic location significantly influences earning potential. It also highlights opportunities for remote work seekers to access high-paying markets without relocation, provided employers support flexible arrangements.\nThis map supports our broader analysis by revealing where economic opportunities are most concentrated, which can inform personal job strategies or workforce development planning."

    "text": "Insights_Salary Variation Across KMeans Clusters\nIn this section, we analyzed how salaries vary across the job clusters produced by our KMeans model. The boxplot visualizes the distribution of salaries within each cluster (Cluster 0 to Cluster 3), allowing us to observe central tendencies, spread, and outliers. We can clearly see that Cluster 1 has the highest median salary, with a large number of high-earning outliers, suggesting it may represent higher-skilled or more specialized job roles. Clusters 0, 2, and 3 have comparatively lower median salaries, with Cluster 3 showing the lowest central value and the narrowest salary range. This suggests that Cluster 3 likely contains more entry-level or uniform-pay positions.\nFrom our perspective, this analysis helps us understand the economic implications of unsupervised clustering. Even though we didn’t use salary as a feature to form the clusters, we see meaningful differences in pay across them. These differences validates that the clusters may capture latent job characteristics (e.g., seniority, technical skill, or industry) that correlate with compensation. It also suggests that further profiling of these clusters using features like remote_type_name or state_name could provide deeper insight into which job segments drive higher salaries."

    "text": "Insights_State-Level Job Distribution Across Clusters\nThis bar chart displays the job distribution across the top 10 U.S. states by KMeans cluster, helping us understand how different job types (as identified by clustering) are spread geographically. Each bar represents the number of job postings in a particular state, broken down by cluster label (0 through 3).\nWe observe that Texas dominates in job count across all clusters, especially Cluster 0, suggesting it is a highly diversified job market that spans multiple segments. North Carolina and Florida also show noticeable volumes, with Florida particularly rich in Cluster 2 jobs — which, based on earlier salary distribution analysis, may include mid- to lower-wage roles. California, while often associated with high-paying jobs, shows a more balanced distribution across Clusters 1, 2, and 3, implying a broader range of roles.\nAs we exploring geographic job trends, this visualization gives us insight into how job market segmentation varies by region. States like Texas and Florida seem to attract or offer a wide range of clustered job types, while states like New York or Washington have a more balanced but smaller presence across clusters. This supports the idea that location influences not just salary, but also the types of roles available, and could be a key factor for workforce planning or job-seeking strategies."
