    "text": "Introduction\nThe job market in 2024 is currently on a significant transformation, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and evolving remote work trends. As AI-driven roles expand, traditional career paths are shifting. This creates new opportunities and challenges across different industries and geographic locations. Thus, the flexibility of remote work is reshaping where professionals live and how companies hire. Understanding “Geographic and Remote Work Analysis” is crucial for businesses, policymakers, and job seekers navigating the changing employment landscape."

    "text": "Research Rationale\nThis study analyzes job market trends using the dataset job-market-analysis-2024, focusing on three key areas: 1. Geographic Distribution of AI vs. Non-AI Job Growth Identifying which cities and states are experiencing the highest job growth in AI-driven careers versus traditional roles. Examining how AI adoption is impacting job availability across different industries and regions. 2. Remote Work Trends Across Industries Investigating whether remote job opportunities are increasing or declining in various sectors. Analyzing how hybrid work models affect hiring patterns and employee mobility. 3. The Evolution of Tech Hubs and Regional Job Markets Assessing whether established tech hubs (e.g., Silicon Valley, Austin) still dominate hiring or if emerging locations are gaining traction. Comparing urban and rural job market dynamics for AI and non-AI careers, including wage disparities and employment opportunities. By examining these trends, this research aims to provide insights into the future of work, helping organizations and professionals adapt to an evolving job landscape influenced by AI adoption and remote work policies"

    "section": "Brief Literature Review",
    "text": "Brief Literature Review\nRecent studies highlight the evolving trends and challenges of remote work across industries. Hansen et al. (Hansen et al. (2023)) analyze remote work distribution, showing that high-skilled jobs have embraced remote work, particularly in the technology sector, whereas manual and service jobs remain on-site. Similarly, Gibson (Gibson (2024)) examines labor market dynamics in Silicon Valley, revealing how remote work is leveraged to attract and retain talent in competitive regions. These studies emphasize the growing divide in remote work opportunities based on job type and location.\nOn the policy side, Olawale et al. (Olawale et al. (2024)) review IT sector remote work policies, stressing the importance of clear guidelines and technology infrastructure for efficiency and security. Meanwhile, Huang (Huang (2024)) explores how AI-driven industries reshape labor structures, further enabling remote work adoption. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive view of remote work’s trajectory, examining the key factors that drive its expansion and emphasizing the need for adaptive policies to keep pace with the evolving digital workforce."

    "text": "3.1 Drop Unnecessary Columns\nWhich columns should be dropped, and why?\nThe columns selected for removal are considered redundant because they either provide duplicate information, are unnecessary for analysis, or have more detailed equivalents in the dataset. For example, \"ID\" serves as a unique identifier but is often not needed for analysis, while \"URL\" and \"ACTIVE_URLS\" contain job posting links that are useful externally but not critical for data processing. Similarly, \"LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP\" is dropped because \"LAST_UPDATED_DATE\" already provides update information in a more readable format. The \"DUPLICATES\" column, which likely flags repeated entries, is also removed since duplicates can be handled separately.\nAdditionally, industry and occupational classification columns like \"NAICS2\" to \"NAICS6\" and \"SOC_2\", \"SOC_3\", \"SOC_5\" are removed because these represent different levels of classification, and more relevant or updated versions (e.g., \"NAICS_2022_2\" to \"NAICS_2022_6\") are already present in the dataset. Removing these redundant columns helps streamline the dataset, making it more efficient to analyze without losing valuable information.\n\n\nCode\ncolumns_to_drop = [\n    \"id\", \"duplicates\", \"last_updated_timestamp\",\n    \"naics2\", \"naics3\", \"naics4\", \"naics5\", \"naics6\",\n    \"soc_2\", \"soc_3\", \"soc_5\"\n]\n\ndf = df.drop(columns=[col for col in columns_to_drop if col in df.columns], inplace=False)\n\nprint(\"Columns after dropping:\", df.columns)\ndf.head()\n\n\nColumns after dropping: Index(['last_updated_date', 'posted', 'expired', 'duration', 'title_raw',\n       'body', 'modeled_expired', 'modeled_duration', 'company',\n       'company_name',\n       ...\n       'naics_2022_2', 'naics_2022_2_name', 'naics_2022_3',\n       'naics_2022_3_name', 'naics_2022_4', 'naics_2022_4_name',\n       'naics_2022_5', 'naics_2022_5_name', 'naics_2022_6',\n       'naics_2022_6_name'],\n      dtype='object', length=107)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlast_updated_date\nposted\nexpired\nduration\ntitle_raw\nbody\nmodeled_expired\nmodeled_duration\ncompany\ncompany_name\n...\nnaics_2022_2\nnaics_2022_2_name\nnaics_2022_3\nnaics_2022_3_name\nnaics_2022_4\nnaics_2022_4_name\nnaics_2022_5\nnaics_2022_5_name\nnaics_2022_6\nnaics_2022_6_name\n\n\n\n\n0\n9/6/2024\n6/2/2024\n6/8/2024\n6.0\nEnterprise Analyst (II-III)\n31-May-2024\\n\\nEnterprise Analyst (II-III)\\n\\n...\nFalse\n6.0\n894731.0\nMurphy USA\n...\n44.0\nRetail Trade\n441.0\nMotor Vehicle and Parts Dealers\n4413.0\nAutomotive Parts, Accessories, and Tire Retailers\n44133.0\nAutomotive Parts and Accessories Retailers\n441330.0\nAutomotive Parts and Accessories Retailers\n\n\n1\n8/2/2024\n6/2/2024\n8/1/2024\nNaN\nOracle Consultant - Reports (3592)\nOracle Consultant - Reports (3592)\\n\\nat SMX i...\nFalse\nNaN\n133098.0\nSmx Corporation Limited\n...\n56.0\nAdministrative and Support and Waste Managemen...\n561.0\nAdministrative and Support Services\n5613.0\nEmployment Services\n56132.0\nTemporary Help Services\n561320.0\nTemporary Help Services\n\n\n2\n9/6/2024\n6/2/2024\n7/7/2024\n35.0\nData Analyst\nTaking care of people is at the heart of every...\nFalse\n8.0\n39063746.0\nSedgwick\n...\n52.0\nFinance and Insurance\n524.0\nInsurance Carriers and Related Activities\n5242.0\nAgencies, Brokerages, and Other Insurance Rela...\n52429.0\nOther Insurance Related Activities\n524291.0\nClaims Adjusting\n\n\n3\n9/6/2024\n6/2/2024\n7/20/2024\n48.0\nSr. Lead Data Mgmt.

First, visualizing missing data with a heatmap helps identify patterns and assess severity. Columns with more than 50% missing values are dropped to avoid unreliable or incomplete data. For numerical fields like \"Salary\", filling missing values with the median ensures the data remains representative without being skewed by outliers.

This approach balances data retention and accuracy, ensuring meaningful analysis without introducing bias.\n\n\nCode\nimport missingno as msno\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Visualize missing data\n# Identify columns with &gt;10% missing values\nmissing_threshold = 0.1  \nmissing_cols = df.columns[df.isnull().mean() &gt; missing_threshold]\n\n# Filter DataFrame\ndf_missing = df[missing_cols]\n\n# Generate heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))  \n\nmsno.heatmap(df_missing)\nplt.title(\"Missing Values Heatmap (Filtered)\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n# Drop columns with &gt;50% missing values\ndf.dropna(thresh=len(df) * 0.5, axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n# Fill missing values\n\ndf_original = pd.read_csv(\"lightcast_job_postings.csv\")\n\ndf[\"salary\"] = df_original[\"salary\"]\n\nsalary_col = \"salary\" if \"salary\" in df.columns else None\n\nif salary_col:\n    df[salary_col].fillna(df[salary_col].median(), inplace=True)\nelse:\n    print(\"Warning: No salary-related column found!\")\n\n\ndf[\"naics6_name\"].fillna(\"Unknown\", inplace=True)\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1152x576 with 0 Axes&gt;"
