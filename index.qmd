## ðŸ“Š Job Market Outlook: Summary & Insights

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 job market using data from Lightcast, with a focus on geographic and remote work trends. Through exploratory data analysis, multiple regression, clustering, skill gap mapping, and text mining, we uncovered critical insights shaping employment opportunities. Our multiple regression model identified experience and job title as the strongest predictors of salary, with high-earning roles concentrated in states like California, New York, and Connecticut. KMeans clustering revealed that certain job typesâ€”particularly those in Cluster 1â€”are associated with significantly higher compensation and often appear in tech-dense regions. Our skill gap analysis showed alignment between in-demand skills (e.g., SQL, Python, Tableau) and the team's current strengths, while also revealing areas for upskilling in cloud technologies and Linux. Finally, text analysis of job descriptions emphasized the importance of not just technical expertise but also teamwork, communication, and real-world project experience.

Based on our findings, we advise job seekers to pursue roles in high-salary states or remote jobs based in those regions, focus on building practical experience, and prioritize mastering high-demand tools like SQL, cloud platforms, and visualization software. Tailoring resumes to reflect key industry terms and showcasing applied projects can also greatly improve competitiveness in todayâ€™s evolving job market.
